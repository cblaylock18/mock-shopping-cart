Initial Notes:
structure and components that I'll need:
-home page (general info and link to shopping page)
-shop page
-page for each item
    -input field for # of items
    -also increment and decrement buttons
    -title for each
    -add to cart button
    -fakestoreapi https://fakestoreapi.com/
-nav bar (same for each page)
-shopping cart (RH side of shop page and accessible as RH pop up on any page)
    -should always display # items in cart
    -check out and pay buttons (don't need to work)
    -cart total should update accordingly
    -ability to remove items from cart
    -once they checkout, reset cart

-maybe use proptypes at the end?
